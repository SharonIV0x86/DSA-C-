Relationship between array indexes and tree element

A complete binary tree has an interesting property that we can use to find the children and parents of any node.

If the index of any element in the array is i, the element in the index 2i+1 will become the left child and element in 2i+2 index will become the right child. Also, the parent of any element at index i is given by the lower bound of (i-1)/2.

Let's test it out,

Left child of 1 (index 0)
= element in (2*0+1) index 
= element in 1 index 
= 12


Right child of 1
= element in (2*0+2) index
= element in 2 index 
= 9

Similarly,
Left child of 12 (index 1)
= element in (2*1+1) index
= element in 3 index
= 5

Right child of 12
= element in (2*1+2) index
= element in 4 index
= 6

Let us also confirm that the rules hold for finding parent of any node

Parent of 9 (position 2) 
= (2-1)/2 
= ½ 
= 0.5
~ 0 index 
= 1

Parent of 12 (position 1) 
= (1-1)/2 
= 0 index 
= 1
