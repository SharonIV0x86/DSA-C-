Suppose we have a hash table with a size of 10 and the constant value we choose is 0.618 (a common choice for A in practice).

    Size of the hash table: 10.
    Key: 42 (the key we want to hash).
    Multiply the key (42) by the constant value (0.618):
    42 * 0.618 = 25.476.
    Extract the fractional part of the result (0.476).
    Multiply the fractional part by the size of the hash table:
    0.476 * 10 = 4.76.
    Round down the result to the nearest whole number (4).
    The rounded value (4) is the hash value, representing the index where the key will be stored in the hash table.

In this example, the key 42 is hashed using the multiplication method to a hash value of 4. Therefore, we would store the key 42 in slot/index 4 of the hash table.

The multiplication method utilizes a constant value, multiplication, and extraction of the fractional part to achieve a hash value. The choice of constant value and the size of the hash table greatly influence the distribution and collision handling capabilities of the method.

It's important to note that this is a simplified explanation, and there are various considerations and optimizations involved in choosing the constant value and determining the hash function's effectiveness in practice.
