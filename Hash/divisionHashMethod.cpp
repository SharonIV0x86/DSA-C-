Here's a step-by-step explanation of the division method:

    You have a hash table with a certain number of slots or buckets. Let's say there are 10 slots numbered from 0 to 9.

    To store an item in the hash table, you calculate the hash value of the item's key using the division method. For example, if the key is 27, you divide it by 10 (the total number of slots) and keep the remainder: 27 % 10 = 7.

    The remainder (7 in this case) is used as the index or slot number where the item will be placed in the hash table.

    If there is no collision (i.e., if the slot is empty), you can store the item in that slot. If there is a collision (another item is already in that slot), you can use a collision resolution technique like chaining (where each slot contains a linked list of items) or probing (where you search for the next available empty slot).

    When you want to retrieve the item from the hash table, you again calculate the hash value of the key using the division method, find the corresponding slot based on the remainder, and retrieve the item stored in that slot.

The division method is straightforward and easy to understand, but it can suffer from poor performance if the data distribution is not uniform or if the number of slots is not chosen carefully. In such cases, other hash functions or techniques may be used to improve performance and minimize collisions.


    Size of the hash table: 10.
    Key: 23.
    Divide 23 by 10: 23 รท 10 = 2 remainder 3.
    The remainder is 3, so the hash value is 3.
    Store the key 23 at index 3 in the hash table.
