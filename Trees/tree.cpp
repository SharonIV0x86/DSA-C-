
    Root node: This is the topmost node in the tree hierarchy. In the above diagram, Node A is the root node. Note that the root node doesnâ€™t have any parent.


    Leaf node: It is the Bottom node in a tree hierarchy. Leaf nodes are the nodes that do not have any child nodes. They are also known as external nodes. Nodes E, F, G, H, 
    and C in the above tree are all leaf nodes.
    Subtree: Subtree represents various descendants of a node when the root is not null. A tree usually consists of a root node and one or more subtrees. In the above diagram, (B-E, B-F) 
    and (D-G, D-H) are subtrees.


    Parent node: Any node except the root node that has a child node and an edge upward towards the parent.


    Ancestor Node: It is any predecessor node on a path from the root to that node. Note that the root does not have any ancestors. In the above diagram, A and B are the ancestors of E.


    Key: It represents the value of a node.


    Level: Represents the generation of a node. A root node is always at level 1. Child nodes of the root are at level 2, grandchildren of the root are at level 3, and so on. 
    In general, each node is at a level higher than its parent.


    Path: The path is a sequence of consecutive edges. In the above diagram, the path to E is A=>B->E.

    
    Degree: The degree of a node indicates the number of children that a node has. In the above diagram, the degree of B and D is 2 each whereas the degree of C is 0.
