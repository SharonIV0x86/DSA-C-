n vertices tree has n -1 edges

A forest is a disjoint union of trees.
in a forest, there is at most one path between any two vertices

Spanning tree
it is a subgraph T of connected graph G is a spanning tree.
T contails all vertices of G and T is a tree.

Spanning Forest.
It is a subgraph that consists of a spanning tree
corresponding to each connected component.
